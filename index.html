          Action research is problem-centered, client-centered, and
          action-oriented. It involves the client system, and a change agent
          involved in conducting a diagnostic, active-learning, problem-finding,
          and problem-solving process. The client and the change agent
          collaborate to identify and prioritize specific problems, analyze data
          to find the root causes, and develop action plans for coping with them
          realistically and practically.

        <p>
          Action Research (AR) is an approach to enquiry which has been used
          since the 1940s. It involves researchers and participants working
          together to understand a problematic situation and change it for the
          better. There are many definitions of the approach, which share some
          common elements. AR focuses on social change that promotes democracy
          and challenges inequality; is context-specific, often targeted on the
          needs of a particular group; is an iterative cycle of research,
          action, and reflection; and often seeks to ‘liberate’ participants to
          have a greater awareness of their situation in order to take action.
          AR uses a range of different methods, both qualitative and
          quantitative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participatory approaches to research, action research, and evaluation
          are based on similar philosophies, theories, and methods. For example,
          they start with many of the same underlying assumptions, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People don’t need advanced degrees or professional credentials to
            conduct valuable research.
          </li>
          <li>
            All groups and cultures have their own biases, including
            professional researchers and evaluators who are trying to remain
            “neutral” or “objective” observers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everyone can contribute valuable expertise, insights, and knowledge
            to a research or evaluation process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Those who are closest to an issue, problem, or program generally
            know the most about it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The involvement of diverse participants with different perspectives
            can help researchers, evaluators, practitioners, and community
            members produce insights that are less biased and closer to the
            truth.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="content2" class="content">
        <h3>1. Introduction to the Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Start by providing a detailed description of the problem or issue
          you're investigating. Explain the context in which the problem exists,
          including any relevant historical, social, or organizational
          background.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> If your action research focuses on improving
          student engagement in a classroom, describe the current state of
          student engagement, any trends or patterns you've observed, and the
          broader educational context.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Relevant Literature</h3>
        <p>
          Include a review of existing research related to your problem.
          Summarize key findings from previous studies to show that the issue is
          recognized and studied within the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Citation Example:</strong> Smith (2020) found that student
          engagement significantly impacts academic performance, particularly in
          high school settings.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Current Practices and Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          Discuss current practices or interventions related to the problem.
          Highlight their strengths and limitations based on your observations
          or existing research.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Citation Example:</strong> According to Jones and Lee (2018),
          current strategies for increasing classroom engagement often fail to
          address individual learning needs.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Specific Context</h3>
        <p>
          Detail the specific setting of your research (e.g., the particular
          school or classroom). Explain any unique characteristics of this
          setting that make it relevant to your study.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Citation Example:</strong> The school in this study has a
          diverse student population, which aligns with the findings of Garcia
          et al. (2019) on diverse educational settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Rationale</h2>

        <h3>1. Justification for the Study</h3>
        <p>
          Articulate why your action research is necessary. Explain how
          addressing this problem will benefit the setting or community you're
          working with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Citation Example:</strong> As highlighted by Williams (2021),
          targeted interventions are essential for improving educational
          outcomes in underserved communities.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Research Gaps</h3>
        <p>
          Identify gaps in existing research or practice that your study aims to
          fill. Demonstrate how your research will contribute new insights or
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Citation Example:</strong> While previous studies such as
          those by Brown and Patel (2017) have explored general engagement
          strategies, few have examined their effectiveness in small-group
          settings.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Potential Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Discuss the potential impact of your research findings. Explain how
          the results could influence practice, policy, or future research.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Citation Example:</strong> Effective strategies for enhancing
          engagement could lead to improved academic outcomes, as suggested by
          Clark et al. (2022).

        <h2>Approaches in APA 7th Edition Manual of Style</h2>

        <h3>1. End-of-text References</h3>
        <p>
          An example of a journal article end-of-text reference in APA form is:
        </p>
        <p>

            >Shertzer, B., & Stone, S. C. (1981). Fundamentals of guidance (4th
            ed.). Boston: Houghton Mifflin.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of a conference paper end-of-text reference in APA form is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote"
            >Zedexk, S., & Baker, H. T. (1971, May). Evaluation of behavioral
            expectation scales. Paper presented.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The words “Retrieved from” precede the URL name as in the following
          example of a journal article reference:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote"
            >Smith, J. (2008, June). Sciences vs. ideologies. Science, 29(3).
            Retrieved from http://www.apa.org/monitor/.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOI number is typically located on the first page of the
          electronic journal article. When cited, this number is placed at the
          end of a reference, as shown in the following example:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote"
            >Smith, J. P. (2005). Mixed methods research: Its controversies and
            potential. Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 3(1), 34–50. doi:
            1038/0278.6133.24.2.226</span
          >
        </p>

        <h3>2. Within-text References</h3>
        <p>
          An example of a within-text reference in APA style where the author
          refers to a single reference:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote"
            >Rogers (1994) compared reaction times for athletes and nonathletes
            in middle schools...</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of a within-text reference in APA style where the author
          refers to multiple references:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote"
            >Past studies of reaction times (Gogel, 1984; Rogers, 1994; Smith,
            1989) showed...</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          When a work has only two authors, you should cite both names every
          time the reference occurs in the text:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote">Kurines and Smith (2009) demonstrated...</span>
        </p>

        <h3>3. Headings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Headings provide important clues for readers that help them
            understand a study.
          </li>
          <li>They divide the material like topics in an outline.</li>
          <li>In APA style, the maximum number of heading levels is five.</li>
          <li>
            Most educational studies include either two or three levels of
            headings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authors seldom use fourth- or fifth-level headings unless their
            research requires many subdivisions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Writing Reviews of Literature Strategies</h2>

        <h3>1. Extent of the Review</h3>
        <p>
          There is no easy answer to how long a literature review should be, but
          you can begin by considering the type of research report you are
          writing.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Dissertations and Theses:</strong> Require an extensive
            review of the literature, often including all identified sources of
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research Plans or Proposals:</strong> A less comprehensive
            literature review may suffice, though guidelines may be set by
            advisors or reviewers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research Proposals and Journal Articles:</strong> Focus on
            studies from the last 10 years, with exceptions for classical
            studies that substantially influence the literature.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Thematic Review of the Literature</h3>
        <p>
          In a thematic review, the researcher identifies a theme and briefly
          cites literature to document it. This approach discusses only the
          major ideas or results from studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach is common in journal articles but also used in
          dissertations and theses. It identifies themes and references the
          literature used to support them.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Study-by-Study Review of Literature</h3>
        <p>
          This approach provides a detailed summary of each study, grouped under
          broad themes. The summaries include elements of an abstract and are
          linked by transitional sentences under subheadings that reflect themes
          and major divisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Writing RRL Critically</h2>
        <p>
          Critical reviews of literature involve analytical persuasive writing,
          which evaluates the work of other researchers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Critically reviewing the literature moves from description to
            critique by linking an evaluative comment to the information.
          </li>
          <li>
            The focus of the comment is often on the research topic rather than
            the researcher.
          </li>
          <li>Such critique may be positive or negative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Aspects to Critique in Literature Reviews:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The conclusions or implications drawn by a researcher because of a
            study.
          </li>
          <li>The methodology of a research study.</li>
          <li>The theoretical framework used.</li>
          <li>The validity and/or reliability of the study.</li>
          <li>The data obtained in a study.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="content4" class="content">
        <p style="text-align: center">
          Theoretical frameworks largely work at the time when a theoretical
          roadmap has been laid about a certain topic and the research being
          undertaken by the researcher carefully analyzes it, and works on
          similar lines to attain successful results.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="content5" class="content">
        <p style="text-align: center">
          A conceptual framework sets forth the standards to define a research
          question and find appropriate, meaningful answers for the same. It
          connects the theories, assumptions, beliefs, and concepts behind your
          research and presents them in a pictorial, graphical, or narrative
          format. A conceptual framework is an underrated methodological
          approach that should be paid attention to before embarking on a
          research journey in any field, be it science, finance, history,
          psychology, etc.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
          A conceptual framework sets forth the standards to define a research
          question and find appropriate, meaningful answers for the same. It
          connects the theories, assumptions, beliefs, and concepts behind your
          research and presents them in a pictorial, graphical, or narrative
          format. Your conceptual framework establishes a link between the
          dependent and independent variables, factors, and other ideologies
          affecting the structure of your research.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
          A critical facet a conceptual framework unveils is the relationship
          the researchers have with their research. It closely highlights the
          factors that play an instrumental role in decision-making, variable
          selection, data collection, assessment of results, and formulation of
          new theories.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
          Consequently, if you, the researcher, are at the forefront of your
          research battlefield, your conceptual framework is the most powerful
          arsenal in your pocket.

              <li>The research question lies at the heart of every piece of academic writing. The research question determines the sources to be quoted, how to structure the argument, and what a paper aims at.</li>
              <li>The research question narrows down the topic and makes sure that the paper has a common thread. Moreover, the research question gives the reader a clear idea of what to expect from the paper.</li>
              <li>You cannot start writing without having a research question in mind. It is easiest to think of a research question as a Wh-question. Finding an answer to the research question you formulate is your personal contribution. You must state your research question right at the beginning, as part of the introduction.</li>

            <h5> Strong Research Questions (Combes, 2019) </h5> 
            <p>•	A good research question is essential to guide your research paper, project or thesis. It pinpoints exactly what you want to find out and gives your work a clear focus and purpose. All research questions should be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Focused</strong> on a single problem or issue </li>
                <li> <strong>Researchable</strong> using primary and/or secondary sources </li>
                <li> <strong>Feasible</strong> to answer within the timeframe and practical constraints </li>
                <li> <strong>Specific</strong> enough to answer thoroughly </li>
                <li> <strong>Complex </strong> enough to develop the answer over the space of a paper or thesis </li>
                <li> <strong>Relevant</strong> to your field of study and/or society more broadly</li>
            </ul>

                          <p>Scope and delimitation are two elements of a research paper. It identifies what topic the research intends to cover. The scope names the information or subject matter that the individual plans to evaluate. However, it is not possible for a researcher to cover varied aspects of of a chosen subject. In this case, the scope can be narrowed down to a manageable topic or concentration known as delimitations. It defines factors the researcher consciously controls for and why they have been eliminated from the study.</p>

                          <p>In action research, sampling techniques are crucial for collecting data that is representative and relevant to the research question. Here are some common sampling techniques used in action research:</p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>	Purposive Sampling: This technique involves selecting participants who are most relevant to the research question. Researchers deliberately choose individuals who have specific characteristics or experiences related to the study. This is particularly useful in action research where the focus is on specific groups or situations.</li>
                              <li>	Convenience Sampling: This method involves selecting participants who are easiest to reach and available at the time of the study. While this technique is often used due to its practicality, it may not always provide the most representative sample.</li>
                              <li>	Snowball Sampling: This technique is used when the population of interest is hard to access. Initial participants are asked to refer others who meet the study criteria. This method is particularly useful for reaching out to specific or hard-to-reach groups.</li>
                              <li>	Stratified Sampling: In this approach, the population is divided into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender, socioeconomic status), and then participants are randomly selected from each stratum. This technique ensures that different subgroups are represented in the sample.</li>
                              <li>	Thematic Sampling: This is used when researchers want to focus on particular themes or issues. Participants are chosen based on their ability to provide insights into these themes. It’s particularly useful in qualitative action research where the goal is to understand specific aspects of a phenomenon.</li>
                              <li>	Systematic Sampling: Researchers select every nth individual from a list or population. For example, every 10th person on a list might be chosen. This technique can be useful when there is a clear, ordered list of potential participants.</li>
                              <li>  Quota Sampling: Similar to stratified sampling, quota sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups and then selecting participants from each subgroup to meet a specific quota. Unlike stratified sampling, participants are not randomly chosen, but the method ensures representation of key subgroups.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>•	Data analysis is a process that involves examining, and molding collected data for interpretation to discover relevant information, draw or propose conclusions and support decision-making to solve a research problem. This involves interpreting data to answer research questions and making research findings be ready for dissemination.  Data analysis also serves as a reference for future data collection and other research activities. During data analysis (Bala, 2005):</p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>	data collected is transformed into information and knowledge about research performed</li>
                                  <li>	relationships between variables are explored</li>
                                  <li>	meanings are identified and information is interpreted.</li>
                                  <li>	Like other research methods, data analysis procedures in quantitative research approach are different from those in qualitative research approach. The general differences of data analysis procedures between these two approaches are summarized in the Chart (Bala, 2005) </li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>•	Data analysis is the most crucial part of any research. Data analysis summarizes collected data. It involves the interpretation of data gathered using analytical and logical reasoning to determine patterns, relationships or trends. (Ancho, 2023)</p>

                            <p>The usual step proceeding data analysis is interpretation. “Interpretation involves <strong> attaching meaning and significance to the analysis, explaining descriptive patterns, and looking for relationships and linkages among descriptive dimensions.</strong> Once these processes have been completed the researcher must report his or her interpretations and conclusions” (Krueger, 1994).</p>
                            <h4>Steps in interpreting data</h4>
                            <p><strong>Keep your research question in mind:</strong> The most important piece of advice for interpreting the results is to keep your research question in mind. Your interpretation should be centered on addressing your research question, and all your analysis should be directed in that direction.</p>
                            <p><strong>Consider alternate explanations:</strong> It’s critical to think about alternative explanations for your results. Ask yourself whether any other circumstances might be impacting your findings, and carefully assess them. This can assist guarantee that your interpretation is based on the evidence and not on assumptions or biases. </p>
                            <p><strong>Contextualize the results:</strong> Put the results into perspective by comparing them to past research in the topic at hand. This can assist in identifying trends, patterns, or discrepancies that you may have missed otherwise, as well as providing a foundation for subsequent research. </p>
